## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

-   Python ^3.12 
-   Poetry (for dependency management)  
-   Spotify Developer Account (to obtain client credentials)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Install dependencies using Poetry:
    ```bash
    poetry install --no-root
    ```
3.  Set up Spotify API credentials:
    -   Create a Spotify Developer account and create an app to get your `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET`.
    -   Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
        ```env
        CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
        CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
        PLAYLIST_ID="your_playlist_id"
        ```
    -   Alternatively, you can set these environment variables manually in your shell.
    -   The script will automatically load variables from `.env` using python-dotenv.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

1.  Run the `main.py` script:
    ```bash
    poetry run python main.py [playlist_id] [options]
    ```
2.  Print the `hitster.pdf` file:
    -   Open the `hitster.pdf` file and duplex print it.
    -   Cut along the provided markings to create the Hitster cards.

## üé≤ How to Play

1.  Open your camera app and scan the QR code.
2.  Spotify will launch and the song will start playing.
3.  After scanning, quickly look away to keep things fair!
    - Since the song title and artist will be visible, the person scanning should not be the one guessing.
    - Since the release year might be visible on the cover, the person scanning should scan and look away.
4.  Have fun!

You can also use [openbeatster](https://github.com/schnitzelburger/openbeatster), a web application for scanning Spotify QR codes and playing tracks using the Spotify Web Playback SDK. With openbeatster, you can host the server on any device in your local network (such as a laptop or Raspberry Pi), control playback from your smartphone by scanning QR codes, and enjoy cross-device control from any device on the same network. This makes playing with these music cards even easier and more interactive!

## üé® Customization

-   Card Layout: Modify the `hitster.typ` file to customize the card layout, size, and appearance.
